            <h2>Part 1: The Mission</h2>

            <h3>What is Telegram?</h3>

            <p>Telegram is a messaging service focused on <span id="bold">simplicity, privacy and a more honest business model</span>. It was founded in 2013 by the founder of VK and is now operating with a $100M grant from him and their plan is to ask users for optional donations once their funds eventually run out. The company’s aim is not to make money, but rather to create an easy to use and trustworthy messaging app that anyone can use freely, so they don’t serve ads or sell user data. It has 200 million monthly active users and in 2017 it grew by more than 50%.</p>

        <div class="block">
            <h3>Why have I chosen it?</h3>

            <p>While it can’t be expected that every company is run at a loss, I think the team behind Telegram deserves a lot of appreciation for working to maintain this service in a landscape where something as simple as messaging is increasingly tied to the questionable data practices of companies like Facebook. On top of that, the Telegram team cares deeply about offering a great experience, so I believe it would make a good critique piece.</p>

            <h3>The Competition</h3>

            <p><span id="fb">Facebook Messenger:</span> with 1.3 Bn users as of Sept 2017, this is one of the leading messaging apps out there, however its attempts to compete with Snapchat have made it bloated with features and Facebook's recent reputation hit as well as the introduction of ads all help create an opening in the market for apps like Telegram.</p>

            <p><span id="whatsapp">WhatsApp:</span> as of Jan. 2018 this messaging app has 1.5 Bn users, and while closer in functionality to Telegram, WhatsApp is limited by being reliant on a phone (no standalone web or desktop clients) and its reputation is also affected by Facebook’s unclear communication about the user data it stores and the resignation of one of the original founders.</p>

            <p><span id="google">Google’s many messaging apps:</span> While Google announced plans to invest in a unified messaging service across its platforms, at the moment their offering is fragmented (Hangouts, Allo, Duo, Android Messages, Voice), which makes it difficult for users to join one specific platform.</p>


            <h3>Why do people use Telegram?</h3>

            <p>I've put some thought into why people use Telegram and why it stands out on the messaging landscape before this exercise, and I’ve concluded it comes down to two key aspects: <span id="bold">privacy</span> and <span id="bold">good UX.</span></p>

            <p>The network effect is both an ally and an enemy to messaging apps and Telegram is no different. It must use its design and features to attract and retain users so that others join the service where all their friends are.</p>
        </div>


        <div class="block">

            <h2>Part 2: The Experience</h2>

            <p>Despite the app's apparently straightforward capabilities, I believe its simplicity and ease of use deserve to be commended.</p>

            <h3>The Good</h3>

            <p>The telegram clients adhere closely to the design guidelines of every platform, which is one of the ways it makes itself accessible to as many different types of users as possible.</p>

        </div>
        <a href="img/002.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="img/002.jpg"></a>

        <div class="block">
                <p>The onboarding starts with a highlight of its features and then asks users for their phone number + a verification code. This process has been refined since I started using the app a year ago. The first slides were added recently, and they should help reduce the drop off rate for people who decided to just try the app but aren’t really sure what it’s capable of.</p>
        </div>
        <a href="img/003.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="img/003.jpg"></a>

        <div class="block">
        <p>Once an account is set up, the app will ask users for access to their contacts (which is used to check for existing friends on the network). The app will then show an empty conversations page that helps users start their first conversation.</p>
        </div>
        <a href="img/004.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="img/004.jpg"></a>

        <div class="block">
            <p>The app offers several standout features that it uses to create a moat between itself and its competitors and provide a more enjoyable messaging experience. These include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Replying to specific messages</li>
                <li>Editing/deleting messages after they were sent (edited messages are clearly labelled for participants to see)</li>
                <li>Instant Content View, which lets users read articles in a clean reader view, play youtube videos without leaving the app and more.</li>
                <li>Secure chats and calls.</li>
                <li>Option to send uncompressed images and large attachments.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <a href="img/005.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="img/005.jpg"></a>

        <div class="block">
            <p>The app also offers deep customisation, all within the guidelines of each OS, letting people change both its appearance and its behaviour to suit their preferences.</p>
        </div>

        <a href="img/006.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="img/006.jpg"></a>


        <div class="block">

            <h3>The Bad</h3>

            <p>Starting a text conversation is very straightforward, but starting an audio or video call could be easier (it requires tapping a friend’s name or profile picture to reveal two different windows). Calls are not shown in the bottom bar by default, which only makes it even more difficult to start a call.</p>

        </div>

        <a href="img/007.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="img/007.jpg"></a>


        <div class="block">

            <p>Telegram offers a rich library of Stickers, however discovering them and managing them once several are installed isn’t as straightforward or clear as it could be. This is only made worse by how managing stickers differs across platforms.</p>

        </div>
        
        <a href="img/008.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="img/008.jpg"></a>


        <div class="block">

            <p>Basic customisation choices like selecting a theme or a colour for the chat bubbles could be done as part of the onboarding to help people learn about the customisation options. If a default option is selected, the step could be optional and thus not require extra work from users who aren’t interested in customising the look of the app.</p>

            <p>Most of the standout features are discovered by chance.</p>

            <p><strong>In conclusion, I think Telegram is well structured and achieves an impressive level of simplicity, although some of its features could be easier to discover and more consistent across different platforms.</strong></p>

        </div>



        <div class="block">

            <h2>Part 3: The Visuals</h2>
                    <h3>The Good</h3>
                    <p>One big part of Telegram’s personality are the stickers, which are beautifully illustrated and quite interesting.</p>
            </div>

            <a href="img/009.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="img/009.jpg"></a>

            <div class="block">

                    <p>The app’s themes are well designed and cover all aspects of the app as well as working across different platforms.</p>

                    <p>The app also adheres to the visual guidelines of each platform, which again makes it easier for users of a particular platform to understand and use the app.</p>

                    <h3>The Bad</h3>

                    <p>The app’s empty states are rather plain.</p>
            </div>
            <a href="img/010.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="img/010.jpg"></a>

            <div class="block">

                    <p>Customisation options are not consistent across platforms (for example not all clients let users change messages colour).</p>
                    <p>The default visuals could be interpreted as a disadvantage by some users. I think that some pages, such as the profile page, could explore a more interesting look.</p>

            </div>

            <a href="img/011.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="img/011.jpg"></a>

           
            <div class="block" id="last">

                    <p><span id="bold">In conclusion, I believe while there is room for improvement on the visual and structural departments, Telegram shines where it matters most and the thinking behind its design has put it well on its way to achieving its mission.</span></p>
                    <p><span id="bold">Thank you for reading.</span></p>
