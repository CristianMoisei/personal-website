                <h1>Glofox</h1>

                <p>Glofox is SAAS startup founded in 2013 and building business management software for the fitness industry. Being created by ex-athletes and studio owners who have seen the pains first hand, they have ambitions to create a platform that frees fitness professionals to focus on what they do best rather than the tedious admin work that comes with running a small business.</P>
                        
                <p>They understand the importance of a great user experience and have hired me to take charge of their efforts.</p>

                </div>
                <p>After months of speaking to users, exploration, failures and successes, I created a design system that I believe will serve Glofox well for years to come.</p>


                <h4>Getting Started</h4>
                <p>I started this project, with a thorough conversation with the stakeholders about what the company's goals are, how we hope to achieve them, what was tried in the past and what assumptions we're making. It's important that we are all on the same page before diving in.</p>
                <p><span class="bold">Talking to people in the company:</span> I spend a good deal of my time learning from the knowledge that different departments in the company have about our users, how we might best help them, and the challenges they face.</p>

                <p><span class="bold">Talking to users:</span> We are designing software for people who aren't us so the best products are those designed by companies who understand their users intimately. I gained a lot of valuable insights observing fitness professionals use either our product or alternative solutions in the real world. I asked them to rank Glofox features based on how valuable they are and how frequently they use them, asked them to walk me through how they achieve certain goals and took notes. I also did interviews over the phone and had a look at the available analytics.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="project-image" id="glofox-02"></div>

        <div class="narrow-container">
                <p>I learned what the product’s strengths and weakness were and came to understand a great deal about what features are most important to our users and why. I learned most of our users see Glofox as the backbone of their business and would be happy to go through a steeper learning curve if this means they get a more powerful product.</p>
                        
                <p>I understood how important building personal relationships with members is to our users and also the extent to which they can benefit from having actionable insights about the day to day operations of their studios.</p>

                <h4>Problems Identified</h4>

                <div class="tags" id="problems">
                        <span>Small bugs were causing daily headaches</span>
                        <span>Useful information was buried in hard to find places</span>
                        <span>No support for tablets</span>
                        <span>Confusing app hierarchy caused users to seek support often</span>
                        <span>Actions performed many times daily require explicit confirmation</span>
                        <span>Lack of a gradual learning curve</span>
                </div>

                <p>A good example of a flow that most users reported as confusing and problematic was booking a member into a class, which was previously done by searching for the member they wanted to book, pressing a vague icon (with no label), being taken to the page where they usually edit their classes and pressing a new book button next to the class they wanted. Users would then be taken back to the dashboard, where a pop-up with the details of the booking would appear.</p>
                        
                <p>If they got something wrong, they would have to cancel and start over.</p>
                <p>You can have a look at the <a class="sweep" target="_blank" href="../images/glofox/old-design.pdf">original design</a> here.</p>


                <h4>Exploring Ideas</h4>

                <p>Once I got a good sense of the problems our users are trying to solve andhow our product is helping or failing to help them, I started exploring ideas. Because of the urgency of the redesign (we were losing users because of all the problems the old interface had), I decided to spend less time than I normally would in the exploratory stages and revisit everything once the fires were out.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="royalSlider">
                 <div class="royalSlider__images">
                        <img class="rsImg" src="../images/glofox/wireframes-01.jpg" alt="image desc" />
                        <img class="rsImg" src="../images/glofox/wireframes-02.jpg" alt="image desc" />
                        <img class="rsImg" src="../images/glofox/wireframes-03.jpg" alt="image desc" />
                </div>

                </div>
        </div>

        <div class="narrow-container">

                <h4>The first version of the design</h4>
                <p>After spending some time exploring and validating ideas, restructuring, redesigning and optimising I created the first version of the new dashboard interface.</p>
                <p>Here are some of the improvements I made:</p>

        </div>

        <div class="narrow-container mobile-no-padding">
                <h4>Impact & Reception</h4>
                <p>The interface was very well received by users, with many of them going out of their way to write us thank you emails for starting to invest in user experience and helping solve the problems they faced every day.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="royalSlider">
                 <div class="royalSlider__images">
                        <img class="rsImg" src="../images/glofox/email-01.jpg" alt="image desc" />

                        <span class="icon-arrow-right"><img src="../images/arrow-right.svg" width="20"></span>
                </div>
        </div>

        <div class="narrow-container mobile-no-padding">

        <p>As a result of this project, I noticed:</p>

        <div class="tags" id="solutions">
                <span>An increase over time of 20 NPS points</span>
                <span>A sharp decrease in support tickets related to UI/UX problems</span>
                <span>An increase in internal customer satisfaction & retention metrics</span>
                <span>A positive change in Glofox's approach towards, and understanding of, UX</span>
        </div>

        <h4>Aftercare</h4>

        <p>Once we started implementing the interface, I also installed Amplitude and Hotjar so we can track its performance properly and added a <a class="sweep mobile-hide" onclick="show()">custom feedback widget</a> <span class="mobile-show">custom feedback widget</span> I designed that was triggered after several actions asking users whether they found that easy to do or not.</p>

        <p>I also continued to refine the interface based on the feedback we received from users. For example, users told us the modals the interface launched with were giving them less space to work with so I switched to the sliding panels you see now. There was also a lot of optimisation work around labels or micro-interactions such as getting some headers to stick to the top when scrolling.</p>


        </div>

        <div class="narrow-container">

                <h1>Other projects I worked on</h1>

                <h4>The mobile app</h4>
                <p>The Glofox Member App is a key component of the package and the main way for a studio’s members to check its schedule and book into classes, manage their membership, make purchases and more.</p>
                <p>Because of this, the new design had to be incredibly easy to use and cover all major use cases, so that gym members actually want to use it and get real value out of it. The app also had to reflect the studio’s brand and identity and do so using a simple design system (apps are customised manually for each client so the simpler the design system, the less work required).</p>
                <p>The current design did not meet any of these criteria and is hurt by a lack of consideration for empty states.</p>
                <p>The new designed aimed to solve all these issues while simplifying the experience and better organising user journeys.</p>

                <p>Glofox's marketing website needed to convey the right information to the key buyer personas in a concise and appealing way, and the designs below aim to achieve this. It also needed to highlight some of the new features and designs.</p>
